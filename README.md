## Attribute Information and Context
#### Age:

Represents the patient's age in years.
Key factor in assessing the risk of heart disease, with older age groups showing higher prevalence.

####  Sex:

Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
Men generally have a higher risk of heart disease compared to women.

#### Chest Pain Type:

Types of chest pain experienced (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).
Specific types of chest pain are strong indicators of heart disease.

####  Resting Blood Pressure:

Patient’s blood pressure in mm Hg when at rest.
High resting blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

####  Serum Cholesterol:

Cholesterol level in mg/dl.
Elevated cholesterol levels are closely linked to increased heart disease risk.

####  Fasting Blood Sugar:

Indicates if fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).
High fasting blood sugar can signal diabetes, which is a risk factor for heart disease.

####  Resting Electrocardiographic Results:

Results of the ECG test (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing left ventricular hypertrophy).
Abnormal ECG results can indicate heart conditions related to heart disease.

####  Maximum Heart Rate Achieved:

The peak heart rate during exercise.
Lower maximum heart rates during exercise are associated with higher heart disease risk.

####  Exercise Induced Angina:

Indicates if the patient experiences angina during exercise (1 = yes, 0 = no).
Presence of exercise-induced angina suggests underlying heart disease.

####  Oldpeak:

ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Measures the severity of heart disease symptoms under stress.

####  Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment:

Slope of the ST segment during peak exercise (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping).
The slope is an important indicator of the heart’s response to exercise.
####  Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy:

Number of major coronary arteries (0-3) visualized via fluoroscopy.
Higher numbers indicate greater coronary artery involvement and risk.

####  Thal:

Thallium stress test results (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect).
Identifies defects in the heart muscle and helps diagnose heart disease.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

#### Prevalence of Heart Disease

Definition: The proportion of patients diagnosed with heart disease.

Calculation: (Number of patients with heart disease / Total number of patients) * 100

Purpose: Measures the overall rate of heart disease in the population.

#### Heart Disease by Gender

Definition: Comparison of heart disease rates between males and females.

Calculation: Separate prevalence rates for males and females.

Purpose: Identifies gender-based differences in heart disease prevalence.

#### Age Distribution of Heart Disease Patients

Definition: Distribution of heart disease patients across different age groups.

Calculation: Count of heart disease patients in each age bracket.

Purpose: Highlights age groups at higher risk for heart disease.

#### Average Resting Blood Pressure

Definition: Mean resting blood pressure of patients diagnosed with heart disease.

Calculation: Sum of resting blood pressure values / Number of heart disease patients.

Purpose: Assesses the typical resting blood pressure level among heart disease patients.

#### Average Serum Cholesterol Level

Definition: Mean cholesterol level of patients diagnosed with heart disease.

Calculation: Sum of serum cholesterol values / Number of heart disease patients.

Purpose: Determines the average cholesterol level in heart disease patients.

#### Chest Pain Type Distribution

Definition: Proportion of different chest pain types among heart disease patients.

Calculation: (Count of each chest pain type in heart disease patients / Total heart disease patients) * 100

Purpose: Identifies common chest pain types associated with heart disease.

#### Exercise Induced Angina Incidence

Definition: Proportion of heart disease patients experiencing angina during exercise.

Calculation: (Number of heart disease patients with exercise-induced angina / Total heart disease patients) * 100

Purpose: Evaluates the prevalence of exercise-induced angina among heart disease patients.

#### Average Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Definition: Mean maximum heart rate achieved by heart disease patients during exercise.

Calculation: Sum of maximum heart rates / Number of heart disease patients.

Purpose: Understands the typical exercise tolerance in heart disease patients.
